# ZPL Development Toolbox

This is a Visual Studio Code extension for supporting ZPL (Zebra label printer language) development. Currently, this includes generic syntax highlighting for ZPL code (`*.zpl` files). Further functionality is under development.

## Limitations

The syntax highlighting does not work correctly for ZPL files that use the `~CC`/`^CC` or `~CT`/`^CT` commands.

## Installation

Install this extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IanCooper.code-zpl) or download the repository manually and extract to `~/.vscode/extensions` on your computer.
